# English Accent Analyzer üó£Ô∏è

A simple web application that analyzes the English accent from a public video URL. It extracts the audio, processes it through a machine learning model and displays the top 3 most likely accent predictions with their confidence scores.

This project was built to demonstrate the practical application of audio processing and machine learning models in a user-friendly web interface.

## üöÄ Live Demo

## ‚ú® Features

  - **Accepts Public Video URLs:** Works with links from YouTube, Loom and direct MP4 URLs.
  - **Audio Extraction:** Automatically downloads and extracts the audio track from the provided video.
  - **AI-Powered Accent Classification:** Uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face to identify English accents.
  - **Top 3 Predictions:** Displays the three most likely accents from 16 accents as in pretrained model here: https://huggingface.co/Jzuluaga/accent-id-commonaccent_ecapa/blob/main/accent_encoder.txt with their corresponding confidence scores for a more nuanced analysis.
  - **Simple & Clean UI:** Built with Streamlit for a straightforward and interactive user experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development Setup

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

  - Python 3.9
  - [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or a Python virtual environment manager (`venv`).
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/).
  - **FFmpeg:** You must have FFmpeg installed on your system and available in your PATH. You can download it from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/supremeninjacoder/AccentClassifierSTApp.git
    cd AccentClassifierSTApp
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python environment:**

    *Using Conda:*

    ```bash
    conda create --name accent-app python=3.9
    conda activate accent-app
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your Hugging Face API Token:**
    The application requires a Hugging Face token to avoid being rate-limited when downloading the model.

      - Create a file inside the `.streamlit` directory named `secrets.toml`.
      - Add your token to this file like so:
        ```toml
        # .streamlit/secrets.toml
        HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN = "hf_YourTokenHere"
        ```

5.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    The application should now be running locally at `http://localhost:8501`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud**. The deployment is configured by the following files in the repository:

  - `requirements.txt`: Specifies the Python dependencies.
  - `packages.txt`: Specifies system-level packages for the Debian environment (like `ffmpeg` and `cmake`).
  - `runtime.txt`: Specifies the Python version to be used.
  - `.streamlit/config.toml`: Contains Streamlit server configurations, such as disabling the file watcher to ensure compatibility with PyTorch.

Any `git push` to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a redeployment with the latest changes.
